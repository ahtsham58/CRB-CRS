# CRB-CRS
# "Towards Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation"

We have two main directories at the root level. 

1. The first named ‘CRB-CRS Code’ contains the complete Python source code for our own developed retrieval-based recommender system. 

2. The second directory, named ‘Data’ includes the data and results for the online study and additional analyses reported in the manuscript.




Before running the scripts in the directory, named 'CRB-CRS Code', please download the ratings data 'ratings_latest.csv' file from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VIDW7gSt7o9tllGTbbA4LnBRUgnlOPUh). Add this file to the path ../CRB-CRS/data/recommenders_item_data/



You may also download ratings data directly from the [MovieLens website](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/)
