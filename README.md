# CRB-CRS
# "Towards Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation"

We have two main directories at the root level. The first named ‘CRB-CRS Code’ contains the complete Python source code for our own developed retrieval-based recommender system. The second directory, named ‘Data’ includes the data and results for the user study and additional analyses reported in the manuscript.


Before runing the scripts in the directory named 'CRB-CRS Code', please download ratings data 'ratings_latest.csv' file from the link given below. Add this file to the path ../CRB-CRS/data/recommenders_item_data/
