you
well
I

genre

you
feeling
today
movieid
is
not
very
well

in
a
different

it
is
honestly
a
great
movie
movieid

a
good
sci
fi
movie
too
i
do
not
think
so
actually
sigourney
weaver
is
though
movieid
is
a
good
alien
type
movie
it
is
about
campers
that
are
being
hunted
by
an
alien
bear
type
thing
definitely
not
for
children
though
also
movieid
is
more
of
a
realistic
alien
movie
it
is
hard
to
follow
at
first
and
may
seem
confusing
but
it
explains
it
all
at
the
end
worth
looking
at

keep
up
haha
it
was
not
as
good

opinion
because
it
was
not
as
funny

sure
thing

i
think
movieid
has
a
lot
of
similarities
and
will
keep
you
guessing
also
movieid
is
a
quite
uniquely
done
movie
in
the
same
style
i
always
like
seeing
new
faces
it
keeps
things
fresh
well
basically
it
is
about
a
home
invasion
and
taking
a
family
hostage
it
gets
to
become
very
thoughtful
with
a
whole
criticism
of
violence
in
media
it
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
no
i
have
not
seen
that
one
yet
looks
very
interesting

hello
horror
is
a
good
genre
do
you
think
you
would
want
something
classic
or
more
recent
excellent
one
of
the
better
recent
horror
movies
is
movieid
it
is
a
revenge
horror
movie
where
a
father
avenges
the
death
of
his
son
by
hunting
the
people
who
killed
him
i
also
saw
movieid
and
did
not
find
it
scary
it
was
still
a
good
movie
though
another
movie
you
could
try
is
movieid
it
is
pretty
recent
and
i
enjoyed
it
good
reviews
too
the
scariest
movie
i
have
ever
seen
probably
is
not
very
scary
but
has
to
do
with
how
old
i
was
when
i
saw
it
I
would
say
it
was
movieid
i
was
young
when
i
saw
it
so
it
was
quite
a
fright
i
have
never
seen
movieid
but
i
might
look
into
it
thanks

me

come
back
yes
what
is
your
favorite
movie
ok
i
do
not
know
the
first
one
at
all
but
i
do
know
the
marvel
movies
and
i
like
most
of
them
did
you
see
movieid
well
since
i
just
watched
the
oscars
did
you
see
movieid
i
hope
that
is
the
right
one
there
are
3
of
them
on
the
list
with
the
same
year
if
you
like
epic
war
movies
i
thought
it
was
good
it
is
a
3
part
story
about
the
british
evacuation
from
france
during
wwii
it
is
not
quite
linear
you
follow
3
different
aspects
of
the
evacuation
land
air
sea
as
they
intersect
during
the
conflict
movieid
but
there
seem
to
be
a
few
of
them
in
this
system
so
i
mean
the
one
by
christopher
nolan
yes
i
recommend
it

did
not
see

might
eventually

my
opinion
it
was
not
to
sappy
it
was
sad
a
little
but
in
a
more
realistic
way
I
am
not
sure
i
would
have
to
look
it
up
that
did
stink
it
was
called
movieid
it
is
a
scottish
comedy
which
is
a
turnoff
for
some
people
but
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
yeah
i
had
no
problem
understanding
it
some
of
the
accents
are
strong

sequel
and
then
a
trilogy
movieid
was
a
remake
but
a
good
one
at
that

the

part
of
his
philosophy
before
that
was
to
meet
people
based
on
an
algorithm
yes
but
his
decision
to
meet
someone
was
based
on
an
unusual
philosophy
i
like
movieid

part
of
that
is

enjoyed

a
comedy
drama

how
about

anything
but
madea
movies
movieid
was
very
scary
the
sequels
not
so
much
movieid
was
very
good
too
i
did
see
that
one
was
not
it
a
foreign
film
it
was
good
though
the
scariest
recent
film
was
movieid
it
was
about
a
single
mother
and
her
weird
kid
that
are
terrorized
by
some
kind
of
evil
entity
in
their
house
it
is
like
nothing
I
have
seen
before
great
have
a
good
one
bye
now
hi
what
sort
of
movie
are
you
looking
for
tonight
that
sounds
like
a
fun
idea
persoanly
i
love
movieid
movieid
and
movieid
they
are
all
different
styles
but
very
funny
ot
it
is
really
funny
if
you
get
the
chance
also
movieid
was
amusing
if
nothing
else
it
will
help
you
forget
this
cold
weather
right
now
well
the
eye
candy
is
good
i
found
the
plot
overly
complicated
but
i
tend
to
dislike
spy
type
movie
plots
true
i
think
i
generally
just
like
to
be
able
to
turn
my
brain
off
and
watch
the
movie
not
have
to
understand
all
of
these
little
details
to
understand
what
should
be
a
simple
plot
what
genres
do
you
enjoy
watching
cool
i
really
enjoyed
watching
movieid
very
interesting
to
watch
so
good
it
really
goes
in
depth
about
all
sides
of
the
story
lets
you
decide
who
did
it
movieid
was
controversial
but
still
intriguing
to
watch
i
cant
spoil
it
i
finished
it
thinking
someone
else
pulled
it
off
for
sure
movieid
i
mean
that
one
just
speaks
for
itself
ha
and
movieid
is
so
crazy
to
watch
and
really
makes
you
wonder
if
theres
really
just
a
thing
as
too
much
house
ha
a
company
that
goes
under
but
the
owner
builds
a
100
million

house

pretty
funny
no

then
most
modern
comedies
aren
t
movieid
for
example
I
have
seen
that
i
liked
it
oooh

little
bit

thanks
hello
what
kind
of
movies
do
you
like
action
drama
etc
have
you
watched
the
movie
movieid
that
is
a
sci
fi
movie
that
i
liked
what
about
the
movie
movieid
that
is
a
combination
of
both
sci
fi
and
horror
i
have
not
watched
movieid
yet
but
my
friends
say
it
is
a
good
movie
so
i
might
give
it
a
try
soon
have
you
watched
the
sequel
to
movieid
movieid
it
is
also
pretty
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
first
one
you
should
definitely
give
it
a
try
it
was
nice
talking
to
you
you
should
definitely
give
it
a
try
it
was
nice
talking
to
you
i
do
it
was
very
good
no
problem
it
was
nice
talking
to
you
anime
or
animated
movies
kind
of
a
difference
there
you
want
a
single
film
or
multiple
if
the
latter
i
would
suggest
movieid
and
it
is
subsequent
titles
no
but
it
does
discuss
politics
and
societal
norms
like
it
it
is
more
of
a
philosophical
political
drama
still
really
good
and
the
subsequent
films
movieid

most
i
have
really
enjoyed
21
jump
street
and
the
sequel
22
jump
street
usually
sequels
are
not
very
good
in
my
opinion
but
22
jump
street
was
actually
pretty
funny
for
my
tastes
yes
but
it
left
me
wondering
and
wishing
and
hoping
i
have
to
say
i
enjoyed
the
hangover
movies
as
well
meet
the
millers
was
a
classic
too
if
you
are
not
turned
off
by
that
style
the
second
one
was
also
pretty
funny

are
right

that
correction
what
about
horrible
bosses
have
you
seen
it
yea
it
may
not
seem
like
much
from
a
premise
perspective
but
it
was
actually
fairly
funny
and
quite
interesting
throughout
had
both
a
good
plot
and
comedy

good
morning
what
kind
of
movie
s
are
you
looking
for
excellent
have
you
seen
movieid
or
movieid
movieid
has
an
all
star
cast
definitely
worth
checking
out
ok
i
think
we
are
all
done
thanks
for
your
time
and
take
care
yes
i
recently
watched
movieid
does
that
sound
like
something
you
would
enjoy
yes
it
is
i
was
excited
since
normally
i
do
not
care
much
for
the
movies
they
nominate
another
good
one
I
have
seen
recently
is
movieid
but
it
is
more
of
a
comedy
me
too
i
catch
all
of
the
avengers
movies
the
last
one
we
saw
was
movieid
at
the
cinema
that
was
my
introduction
to
the
films
as
well
i
was
hooked
do
you
watch
movieid
too
i
have
not
seen
that
one
yet
i
have
it
and
I
am
saving
it
for
a
special
occasion
it
is
nice
talking
to
another
marvel
fan
movieid
was
great
too
I
am
not
sure
why
logan
gets
all
of
the
individual
movies
but
i
can
live
with
that
i
will
I
am
looking
forward
to
it
i
liked
it
although
it
was
a
little
confusing
i
am
paying
more
attention
though
since
they
are
going
to
combine
with
the
avengers
in
movieid
i
am
too
the
only
aspect
that
is
a
negative
to
the
anticipation
is
that
it
will
be
a
two
part
movie
that
is
good
because
i
can
look
forward
to
the
next
one
but
I
am
sure
I
will
want
to
see
it
immediately
after
the
first
part
it
was
great
talking
to
you
i
hope
you
enjoy
the
upcoming
movies
although
there
is
not
much
doubt
they
will
be
great
hi
what
kind
of
movie
are
you
looking
for
today

movie

you
see
movieid
with
matt
damon
yes
avatar
won
awards

to
go

the
resources
on
earth
are
all
depleted
it
was
pretty
interesting
hope
my

that
weird

will
not
expect

turn

pretty
well

thank
you
goodbye
hello
what
sort
of
recommendations
are
you
looking
for
that
was
a
good
one
let
me
think
for
a
minute
did
you
see
movieid
it
was
2016
but
along
similar
lines
i
think
movieid
is
similar
i
do
not
know
why
i
did
not
think
of
this
earlier
did
you
see
movieid
hello
what
type
of
movies
do
you
like
how
about
movieid
did
you
watch
movieid
me
neigher
didn
t
watch
it
movieid
one
of
my
favorites
movieid
also
a
very
good
ine
of
tom
hanks
me
too
i
never
get
tired
of
watching
it
ok
nice
chatting
with
you
have
a
nice
day
hi
how
are
you
today
sure
i
love
a
mystery
noted
have
you
seen
movieid
or
movieid
i
have
not
seen
it
but
i
hear
movieid
is
good
great
i
hope
they
are
what
you
wanted
hmm
weird
request
but
i
think
i
have
an
idea
there
is
movieid
and
movieid
to
start
the
first
is
more
horror
and
the
second
more
comedy
but
both
are
enjoyable
i
happen
to
agree
with
you
there
then
what
about
movieid
what
with
the
little
furballs
that
eat
people
no
they
are
not
hairballs
per
se
but
these
furry
quot
critters
quot
that
are
highly
aggressive
and
carnivourous
it
is
hilarious
you
might
like
it
okay
what
about
movieid
yes
there
is
a
prequel
also
very
good
no
it
tells
the
story
of
the
norwegians
that
were
killed
at
the
other
camp
and
why
they
blew
up
the
space
ship
came
out
in
2013

think

weekend
can
i
help
you
find
a
movie
that
was
a
good
one
have
you
seen
movieid
daniel
day
lewis
is
awesome
in
it
movieid
is
a
bit
more
romance
than
drama
but
i
liked
it
too
movieid
or
maybe
movieid
if
you
are
into
war
movies
movieid
was
phenomenal
that
should
be
the
one
you
watch
first
you
are
welcome
hey
I
have
never
seen
that
film
bit
before
my
time
but
if
you
like
fantsy
you
might
like
movieid
or
movieid
yup
haha
not
really
sure
if
that
is
fantasy
or
sci
fi
but
great
movie
nonetheless
movieid
was
a
bit
disappointing
for
me
too
movieid
with
a
bit
of
dreaminess
the
opera
singer
bit
is
classic
ohhh
I
have
heard
that
they
are
a
good
read
i
guess
that
could
be
just
the
barrier
to
entry
for
that
series
be
committed
or
do
not
even
try
same

it
right

hi
what
movie
are
you
looking
for
movieid
is
a
funny
movie
with
jada
pinkett
smith
if
you
are
looking
for
a
dramedy
than
movieid
is
a
funny
one
it
is
basically
about
greta
gerwigs
life
whoc
is
hilarious
or
something
like
is
movieid
with
woody
harelson
is
a
great
comedy
with
a
great
storyline
okay
what
about
movieid
or
maybe
movieid
okay
have
a
great
day
im
actually
new
as
well
what
kind
of
movies
are
you
interested
in
thus
us
a
hard
question
for
me
but
i
think
movieid
is
my
top
i
love
scifi
too
which
movieid
is
your
favorite
she
honestly
is
in
incredible
through
the
whole
thing
what
are
your
thpughts
on
movieid
or
movieid
the
prequels
are
slightly
less
painful
if
you
watch
in
machete
order
i
think
so
you
do
movieid
then
movieid
movieid
movieid
and
end
with
movieid
it
shifts
the
perspective
in
some
fun
ways
because
2
and
three
then
become
flashbacks
in
the
original
arc
rather
than
their
own
messy
stand
alone
thing
its
also
just
a
fun
way
to
kill
a
weekend
if
you
do
not
have
other
plans
I
am
not
sure
if
they
have
worked
in
the
new
films
yet
but
theres
lots
of
discussion
if
you
just
google
movieid
and
machete
order

i
watched
movieid

day
hi
i
would
recommend
a
recent
horror
film
like
movieid
great
movie
all
around
well
this
is
not
exactly
a
horror
movie
but
i
would
say
movieid
i
do
not
want
to
give
away
too
much
but
there
are
some
horror
elements
within
the
movie
and
there
is
one
scene
in
particular
that
rivals
most
horror
movies
a
classical
one
is
movieid
also
a
stephen
king
novel
movie
i
would
even
throw
out
there
a
movie
like
the
movieid
series
just
cause
it
is
nice
to
have
a
parody
on
the
horror
series
even
something
like
movieid
plays
on
that
too
despite
being
mostly
a
comedy
well
to
be
honest
i
do
not
really
like

also
like
movieid
or
movieid
too
no
problem
have
a
great
night
hi
i
would
recommend
movieid
and
movieid
movieid
is
based
on
a
true
story
movieid
is
also
based
on
true
story
movieid
and
movieid
are
great
too
you
too
bye
of
course
i
can
i
have
to
recommend
you
check
out
three
movies
the
first
you
should
see
is
movieid
follow
that
up
with
movieid
make
sure
you
first
watch
movieid
firs
though
that
is
very
important
to
the
story
then
conclude
with
movieid
those
should
take
you
some
time
to
finish
they
are
quite
the
experience
oh
i
know
better
indeed
they
were
check
the
better
ones
out
and
try
not
to
have
night
mares
bout
those
terrible
follow
ups
take
care
yeah
nick
cage
right
they
find
what
exactly
again
was
it
something
about
masons
ala
dan
brown
bools
what
was
the
conflict
someone
was
chasing
them
to
keep
the
secret
i
think
was
this
the
one
where
there
was
a
secret
room
in
the
white
house
or
congress
or
was
that
another
chase
the
illuminati
style
vehicle
yeah
i
liked
the
explanation
of
the
masonic
stuff
inarchitecture
and
the
dollar
bill
all
that
stuff
is
cool
oh
yeah
it
is
a
kickbach
chase
movie
and
some
of
the
info
is
actually
true
it
just
exxagerates
some
of
the
significance
of
it
as
i
recall
it
was
less
good
like
a
sequal
often
is
they
surprised
me
how
fun
they
were
and
special
effects
and
cg
were
like
state
of
art
really
it
gets
so
realistic
that
some
people
say
that
fotos
and
film
are
not
even
proof
of
anything
these
days
same

almost
the

i
also
really
liked
movieid
the
music
is
phenomenal
and
for
a
good
live
action
watch
movieid
it
is
a
remake
of
the
animated
version
from
the
70
s
though
i
liked
the
original
a

movieid
movieid

type
of

about

no
problem
bye
hello
there
what
type
of
movies
do
you
enjoy
yeah
for
sure
something
older
or
more
modern
movieid
is
a
classic
but
I
would
imagine
you
have
seen
that
movieid
is
good
especially
if
you
have
seen
the
original
the
new
one
is
not
animated
i
would
also
recommend
movieid
since
you
mentioned
movieid
I
would
say
so
it
is
very
similar
to
the
animated
version
movieid
no
problem
enjoy
and
have
a
good
rest
of
your
day

about
movieid
i
know
you
said
no
kaiju
monsters
but
this
one
is
really
good
well
this
one
is
more
of
a
mystery
than
a
smasher
flick
there
is
also
2
sequels
movieid
and
movieid
both
are
good
but
the
story
is
far
from
over
the
first
2
are
the
third
the
paradox
is
on
netflix
only
at
the

bull
who
escapes
captivity
from
a
matador

that
is
basically
it

funny

bull

more
than

movieid
it
is
a
classic
super
hero
movie
i
thought
movieid
was
a
horrible
movie
full
of
divisiveness
those
were
both
horrible
films
as
well
i
did
not

i
would
recommend
a
real
super
hero
movie
such
as
movieid
with
gene
wilder
you
are
telling
me
that
willy
wonka
is
not
a
super
hero
he
has
oompa
loompas
which
are
a
mythical
creature
working
for
him
to
make
his
candy
so
you
are
saying
that
you
agree
that
willy
wonka
actually
exists
in
real
life
i
consider
anyone
who
makes
an
everlasting
gobstopper
a
superhero

will
have
to
agree
to
disagree
capitulation

what
genre
of
movies
can
i
suggest
for
you
today
there
are
the
classic
oldies
like
movieid
or
one
of
my
personal
favourites
is
movieid
edging
on
thriller
but
plenty
of
action
you
have
also
got
movieid
if
you
enjoy
cars
movieid
i
meant
i
agree
movieid
are
great
movies
have
you
ever
seen
movieid
another
good
car
movie
i

not
sure
i
have
not
seen
that
one
thanks
bye
im
not
really
into
scary
movies
but
i
have
watched
movieid
i
think
is
a
good
movie
yeah
i
enjoyed
it
to
im
more
into
cartoon
movies
like
movieid
hi
what
are
you
here
for
the
last
very
good
movie
i
saw
was
movieid
it
was
very
heartfelt
and
funny
i
also
saw
movieid
which
was
action
packed
and
movieid
i
also
rewatched
movieid
and
it
was
just
as
funny
as
i
remembered
i
think
movieid
felt
more
like
a
classic
coming
of
age
movie
there
were
not
any
fancy
effects
and
it
was
simple
but
that
is
why
i
liked
it
it
really
stood
out
among
the
current
movies
that
all
have
cgi
or
overdone
plots
it
went
back
to
basics
which
was
really
refreshing
i
hope
i
suggested
some
things
you
can
watch
i
have
not
seen
that
I
will

it

is
one
of
those
deeper
movies
also
movieid
was
really
good
and
also
deep
it
is
about
a
baseball
player
going
through
life
changes
while
trying
to
make
it
big
first
movie
i
saw
with
robert
redford
how
about
something
like
movieid
it
is
probably
one
of

most
hilarious
movies
I
have
seen
or
again
if
we
are
going
for
older

movieid
might
qualify
as
sports

problem

them

you
decide

film
i
saw
an
old
twilight
zone
episode
recently

i
think
it
was
called
five
characters

of
an
exit

wonder

inspired
the

robin
williams

was
in

is
hilarious
too
robin
williams
character
has
a
couple
kids
that
are
bratty
so
he
rents
an
rv
and
takes
them
across
country
and
goes
camping
and
just
everything
goes
wrong
so
another
robin
williams
movie
movieid
he
invents
a
substance
like
rubber
and
he
misses
his
wedding
because
he

this
substance

for
you

a
good
one
have
you
seen
the
latest
star
wars
yet
movieid
i
think
it
was
good
although
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
disagreement
on
that
score
how
about
movieid
that
is
a
fun
movie
and
not
too
grown
up

no

william
dafoe
sean
patrick
flanery
and
norman
reedus
it
is
an
amazing
movie
what
about
movieid
that
is
a
good
category
I
am
going
to
have
to
think
for
a
second
i
watched
a
good
british
comedy
called
movieid
the
british
are
good
with
that
genre
i
just
remembered
another
one
it
is
called
movieid
it
stars
the
actor
that
was
the
lead
in
movieid
the
plot
involves
two
men
that
work
as
basically
hired
help
for
the
mafia
they
are
really
good
friends
but
end
up
pitted
against
one
another
they
use
dark
humor
to
deal
with
the
situation
but
it
has
a
tragic
ending
one
of
my
favorite
movies
is
movieid
i
liked
it
so
much
I
have
watched
it
probably
6
or
7
times
cool
i
hope
you
like
them
i
like
dark
comedies
too
and
it
is
sometimes
hard
to
find
good
movies
of
that
sort
i
haven
t
i
will
check
it
out
though
movieid
is
another
one
that
sort
of
fits
in
this
category
i
will
definitely
check
out
the
movie
you
mentioned

love
british
acting

family

film

little
romance
hope

suggestions
helped
great
talking
with
you
bye
hey
there
what
kind
of
movies
are
you
interested
in
movieid
is
one
of
my
favorites
movieid
was
also
funny
i
liked
those
to
i
think
you
have
some
movies
have
a
good
day
hello
what
kind
of
movies
do
you
like
movieid
was
a
good
one
did
you
see
the
sequel
movieid
i
agree
it
was
not
as
good
i
have
not
seen
movieid
but
i
see
that
angelina
jolie
is
in
it
did
you
see
movieid
that
is
also
an
action
comedy
starring
her
yeah
i
am
surprised
i
have
not
heard
of
it
but
i
am
always
looking
for
a
good
thriller
sure
plus
brad
pitt
stars
in
movieid
it
was
good
chatting
with
you
have
a
good
night
good
bye
hello
can
i
help
you
find
a
movie
have
you
seen
movieid
or
movieid
if
you
like
magic
tricks
movieid
was
one
of
my
favorite
movies
movieid
is
one
of
the
best
then
i
would
say
watch
movieid
and
then
finally
movieid
and
you
will
sincerely
start
to
question
reality
it
really
depends
how
far
down
the
rabbit
hole
you
want
to
go
you
can
always
try
movieid
i
think
the
last
one
i
mentioned
was
animiated
movieid
has
a
great
soundtrack
i
think
all
the
acting
in
each
of
those
movies
is
equally
good
I
am
not
sure
what
you
are
asking
can
i
help
you
find
a
movie
goodbye

is
well
what
kind
of
movies
do
you
like
yes
sure
no
preference
ok
i
would
highly
recommend
movieid
its
full
of
action
and
fast
fighting
scenes
another
one
i
find
action
packed
is
movieid
and
movieid
they
are
oldies
but
still
classics
and

of
humor
and
action

seen
any
of
the
films
mentioned

and
if

by
your
own
speculations
and
analysis

want
something
more
casual

still
sci

a
movie
i
would

animated
space
adventure

a
good
choice
for
a
movieid

try
movieid
it
is
an
animated
series
that
explains

of
the
backstory
you
might
also
like
movieid
which
is
a
different
sci
fi
film

also
has
great
visuals
and
an
imaginative
design

some
movieid
with
seth
rogan
great
film
haha
i
loved
it
too
no
problem
have
a
great
day
hello
how
are
you
so
i
heard
you
are
interested
in
movies
let
us
start
off
with
some
genres
that
you
like
sorry
i
have
not
hmm
let
us
see
sorry
im
looking
at
netflix
to
see
if
i
ca
assist
with
finding
you
movies
in
that
genre
that
I
have
enjoyed
yes
i
have
seen
that
movie
and
i
rather
disliked
it
the
movie
movieid
was
not
all
that
attention
grabbing
I
am
more
interested
in
the
horror
genre
sci
fi
all
that
jazz
sorry
about
me
taking
too
long
to
assist
with
finding
a
movie
one
moment
please
have
you
ever
seen
movieid
i
enjoyed
both
the
novel
and
the
movie
i
greatly
recommend
it
for
sci
fi
lovers
aside
from
movies
a
really
good
show
in
netflix
I
would
recommend
is
black
mirror
each
episode
is
a
different
story
and
it
focuses
on
the
future
of
technology
and
how
it
could
go
wrong
in
the
future
yeah
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
first
season
is
alright
but
the
3rd
and
4th
season
i
really
enjoyed
each
episode
is
different
so
there
is
variety
in
the
show
it
is
definitely
a
show
that
makes
you
sit
down
and
think
for
a
while
after
watching
hope
you
enjoy
yes
i
have
funny
story
i
watched
that
movie
during
a
thnderstorm
with
my
sister
at
home
and
as
seen
as
we
finished
it
the
power
went
out
talk
about
scary
haha
i
did
not
have
a
choice
sadly
have
you
ever
seen
movieid
well
if
you
do
not
like
horror
japanese
horror
is
even
more
scary

to
you
have
a
great
rest
of
your
day

haha
well
a
lot
of
independant
movies
like
movieid
are
certainly
unusual
especially
when
it
comes
to
a
big
star
like
brad
and
an
independant
film
its
almost
like

someone

loved
you
could
tie
it
in
in
a
roundabout
kind
of
way

the

bruce
willis

haha
ooo
I
have
been
meaning
to
see
that
movieid
is
one
of
my
favorites
cool
thanks
happy
holidays
to
you
too
goodbye
hello
what
type
of
movies
do
you
like
maybe
i
can
help
ya
find
something
good
oh
i
know
several
first
how
old
are
your
kids
i
just
recently
saw
movieid
that
was
a
good
one
of
course
i
really
liked
movieid
but
the
beginning
might
be
slightly
too
scary
for
the
younger
one
also
i
highly
recommend
movieid
but
the
beginning
might
be
slightly
too
scary
for
the
younger
one
if
you
do
not
mind
anime
i
recommend
movieid
anything
pixar
is
good
of
course
movieid
movieid
inc
movieid
and
movieid
so
on
but
your
kids
probably
already
seen
those
if
you
do
not
mind
older
films
i
recommend
the
first
movieid
did
not
really
see
the
sequels
but
heard
they
are
not
as
great
but
still
good
for
kids
you
might
like
movieid
but
not
sure
about
the
kids
it
is
rather
serious
in
parts
movieid
is
definitely
one
for
any
parent
it
is
about
this
woman
who
has
to
raise
two
kids
alone
who
can
turn
into
wolves
at
will
you
can
find
clips
of
it
on
youtube
anyway
i
hope
you
enjoy
the
suggestions
wow
those
go
back
a
long
long
time
and
hi
how
are
you
doing
today
alright
well
I
am
going
to
suggest
a
couple
of
films
but
they
will
be
different
genres
since
it
seems
like
you
have
diverse
film
tastes
it
is
very
risque
but
has
an
all
star
cast
like
movieid
and
a
comedy
and
that
is
movieid
small
car
chase
but
very
madcap
ok
now
along
the
lines
of
movieid
I

the
first
2
for
an
recent

a
second

2019
i
agree
i
have
watched
all
the
series
that
they
have
on
tv
as
well
that
is
how
i
watch
them
as
i
do
not
have
cable
that
is
true
it
is
easier
when
you
have
the
time
to
watch
something
on
your
own
time
not
on
their
time
thanks

the
chat

be
another
one

i
had
super
high
expectations
but
i
still

heard
movieid
was
very
good
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
yeah
it
is
basically
all
comic
book
movies
yeah
the
studios
want
franchises
and
they
are
easy
to
franchise
i
did
see
movieid
over
thanksgiving
great
to
revisit
that
one

too
i
like
movieid
the
most
dang
I
am
striking
out
here
one
i
will
not
recommend
is
the
new
movieid
i
liked
the
original
movieid
more
youre
welcome
tim
curry

a
much
better

in
the
original
one
hello
there
I
am
good
and
you
I
would
like
to
recommend
a
movie
for
you
what
type
of
movies
do
you
like
excellent
what
about
things
like
movieid
or
movieid
and
have
you
seen
movieid
it
came
out
this
year
and
it
was
surprisingly
funny
it
does
not
sound
funny
but
it
is
it
was
written
by
this
comic
and
his
wife
and
is
a
true
story
about
how
they
met
basically
they
started
dating
and
he
was
kind
of
a
jerk
and
they
broke
up
but
right
after
that
she
got
really
sick
and
was
put
into
a
medically
induced
coma
she
had
not
taken
his
name
off
of
her
medical
emergency
list
and
he
gets
called
while
he
is
at
her
bedside
her
parents
fly
into
the
area
now
one
of
the
reasons
it
did
not
work
out
is
because
they
are
from
two
different
cultures
and
he
never
told
his
parents
who
were
trying
to
arrange
a
marriage
for
him
that
he
was
dating
someone
her
parents
are
played
by
ray
romano
and
holly
hunter
i
did
not
know
the
main
comic
from
before
but
he
is
in
some
show
called
silicon
valley
and
she
was
in
a
movie
called
movieid

movieid

maybe
movieid
i
have
not
seen
movieid
movieid
was
a
good
robert
townsend
movie
you
might
like
movieid
also
if
you
like
jack
nicholson
it
sounds
like
it
might
be
movieid
is
great
tongue
in
cheek
if
you
like
british
humor
well
that
should
get
you
started
thanks
for
the
talk
hello
oh
I
am
sorry
you
are
feeling
sick
hopefully
you
feel
better
soon
can
you
tell
me
1
feel
good
movie
you
have
seen
and
liked
do
you
ever
watch
animated
films
lol
ok
i
get
it
i
love
watching
a
movie
called
movieid
when
i
need
cheering
it
is
about
a
stand
in
who
is
installed
instead
of
the
real
president
of
the
us
it
is
very
light
and
has
a
feel
good
story
it
is
with
sigourney
weaver
and
kevin
kline
it
is
a
lot
more
fun
than
it
sounds
but
it
is
not
slapstick
oh
well
she
is
a
main
character
in
this
so
you
would
probably
not
want
to
see
it
lol
i
also
like
movieid
because
it
has
a
mix
of
history
and
fantastical
story
telling
about
love
it
is
really
a
sweet
love
story
okay

a
couple
other
suggestions
are
movieid

movieid
have
you
seen
any
of
those
my
best
friends
wedding
is
a
classic
for
sure
the
other
three
mentioned
movies
probably
owe
a
lot
of
credit
to
that
movie
um
not
really
bridesmaids
is
sorta
slapstick
in
it
is
comedy
whereas
the
one
s
i
mentioned
are
more
situational
comedy

else
can
i
help
you

i
saw
movieid
two
nights

good
scary
though

movieid
again

mebbe
not
so
much
action
how
about

a
pretty
tough
topic

pretty
good
for
an
older

who
loses
his
famly

the
loss
afterward

a
mri
machine
only
movie
they
had
playing
i
was
more
uncomfortable
at
25
weeks
with
twins
to
pay
much
attention
did
you
like
movieid
or
movieid
its
sad
but
a
good
movie
have
a
great
night
hey
there
what
kind
of
movies
are
you
into
perhaps
a
comedy
like
movieid
or
a
drama
like
movieid
have
you
seen
any
of
the
ones
I
have
mentioned
movieid
was
pretty
good
you
might
like
movieid
i
think
you
have
a
good
set
of
movies
have
a
good
day
bye
hello
i
would
like
to
recommend
the
movie
movieid
it
is
a
really
fun
movie
with
a
great
soundtrack
good
thanks
how
are
you
you
have
good
taste
yeah
I
am
trying
to
think
this
one
is
not
like
movieid
but
have
you
seen
movieid
i
just
recently
watched
it
and
it
is
very
funny
people
have
compared
movieid
to
movieid
but
i
feel
like
movieid
is
more
approachable
ah
i
have
not
seen
that
version
i
prefer
the
old
rankin
bass
movieid
feels
more
true
to
the
book
no
worries
i
think
the
thing
that
changed
is
that
newer
movies
are
not
willing
to
take
as
many
chance
or
at
least
the
bigger
studios
pixar
takes
chances
and
makes
good
movies
always
easier
to
use
something
existing
than
to
try
original
thought
nice
talking
to
you
have
a
great
day
hello
what
type
of

the
only
one
that
comes
to
mind
that
I
have

is
movieid
that
i
saw
when

was
pretty
terrifying

tough
one

to
give
me
an
idea
alright
i
think
i
can
help
you
have
you
seen
movieid
it
is
definitely
suspenseful
alright
that
is
a
great
film
too
i
would
recommend
movieid
for
sure
as
well
as
movieid
movieid
was
awesome
let
me
think
of
something
similar
to
that
have
you
seen
movieid
yet
not
exactly
the
same
as
movieid
but
worth
the
watch
and
similar
enough
i
think
hopefully
those
will
be
some
good
additions
to
your
list
also
because
it
is
on
my
mind
movieid
is
a
must
watch
in
my
opinion
alright
well
you
are
welcome

have
you

also
another
good
one
is
movieid

richard
pryor
i
love
that
movie
too
if
you
like
80s
comedies
you
will
probably
like
movieid
it
is
different
but
very
funny
even
if
it
is
from
the
70s
lol

many
sequels

a

a
fondness
for
superheros
lol
the
first
two
were
great
the
third
not
so
much
it
felt
like
they
did
it
for
the
sake
of
doing
it
well
to
be
fair
those
have
a
place
in
the
cinematic
universe
not
so
much
with
movieid
I
will
tell
you
next
round
this
hits
complete
hello

kind
of
movies
are
you
looking
for
nice
love
both
of
those
have
you
seen
the
new
movieid
movie
another
good
one
if
movieid
is
yea
they
did
such
a
good
job
with
it
super
creepy
you
are
welcome
have
a
good
one
hi
what
kind
of
movie
do
you
want
to
see
did
you
liked
movieid
movieid
is
on
netflix
and
it
is
as
good
it
is
like
movieid
a
film
about
family
relation
funny
yet
serious
not
wacky
like
movieid
movieid
has
a
serious
adam
sandler
like
movieid
sorry
i
did
not
see
it
oh
thanks
for
the
information
hi
there
sounds
like
you
are
into
a
bit
of
everything
any
preference
for
time
period
since
you
like
family
oriented
comedy
I
will
suggest
a
few
of
my
favorites
of
bill
murray
can
not
go
wrong
with
movieid
and
movieid
though
murray
only
does
a
voice
over
in
the
second
choice
oh
okay
great
then
what
about
movieid
or
movieid
they
lean
a
little
more
to
the
adult
in
terms
of
theme
but
are
good
in
my
opinion
I
am
really
fond
of
the
second
scarlet
johansson
is
in
it
it
is
about
2
people
who
meet
in
tokyo
to
produce
a
commercial
but
find
love
and
solace
in
one
another
and
while
we
are
on
the
subject
of
love
movieid
starring
joaquin
phoenix
is
another
good
one
coincidentally
it
also
stars
johansson
but
she
only
does
a
voice
over
of
his
love
interest
guess
that
about
covers
it
need
any
more
suggestions
alright
i
hope
you
have
a
great
time
watching
those

many
of
those
i
would
start
with
movieid
it
is
a
drama
with
a
thriller
flair
there
is
also
something
like
movieid
drama
with
romance
the
first
is
about
a
man
who
loses
his
memory
every
day
but
must
solve
his
wife
s
murder
there
is
also
something
like
movieid
it
has
a
lot
of
romance
but
did
make
me
cry
several
times
a
man
writes
letters
to
his
wife
which
she
reads
and
follows
to
the
instructions
after
he
dies
in
a
way
of
grieving
i
would
also
say
something
like
movieid
it
is
very
good
there
is
also
a
lesser
known
movie
called
movieid
with
a
lot
of
drama
a
coming
of
age
drama
involving
a
13
year

shoud
if

fun
plot
there

movieid
glad
to

good
bye
good
day
how
may
i
help
you
comedy
is
so
subjective
do
you
mind
giving
me
a
couple
ideas
of
what
you
found
as
a
romantic
comedy
i
have
to
say
even
though
much
of
her
earlier
work
were
in
the
comedy
genre
as
an
adult
she
is
really
moved
into
a
heavy
drama
genre
it
is
good
i
think
anyways
the
first
suggestion
is
not
a
reese
film
but
is
funny
and
that
is
movieid
she
did
but
then
she
went
into
the
whole
movieid
series
anyway
if
you
like
reese
and
have
not
seen
movieid
and
the
sequel
it
is
really
light
comedic
watching
a
modern
reese
comedy
I
would
say
would
be
movieid
sophia
vigara
is
in
that
too
ok
you
too
happy
reese
day

yet

really
good
one
or
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
more
gritty
or
serious
movieid
is
one
of
my
favorite
superhero
movies
yeah
it
is
pretty
funny
it
is
not
as
vulgar

funny

a
fantastic
thriller
one
of
my
favorites
but
there
is
not
too
much
action
it
is
more
psychological
for
an
action
thriller
you
could
always
try
the
taking
of
pellham
123
either
movieid
or
the
original
it
was
based
on
movieid

very
disjointed
in

boring
i
was
wondering
if
my
younger
self
would
have
found
it
profound
however
i
can
always
throw
back
to
movieid

i
am
not
that
old
a
bad
movie
can
be
fun
and
a
good
documentary
like
movieid
can
be
frightening
how
about
movieid
did
you
see
that
sadly

din

bye
now
aaaand
hello
hey
how
is
things
not
so
bad
not
so
bad
what
about
you
so
tell
me
what
is
the
oldest
movie
you
can
remember
seeing
wow
that
is
a
good
one
what
a
creepshow
bette
davis
in
one
of
her
last
film
roles
oh
if
you
liked
that
one
tell
me
you
saw
movieid
even
creepier
oh
wow
you
have
a
treat
awaiting
then
that
is
william
holden
and
the
silent
film
actress
gloria
swanson
she
came
out
of
retirement
to
play
that
role
people
had
not
seen
her
in
decades
that
is
why
it
blew
people
s
minds
that
is
why
it
blew
people
s
minds
she
basically
plays
herself
do
not
look
it
up
the
ending
is
the
twist
it
will
stay
with
you
not
horrifying
just
breathtaking
and
ghastly
if
you
have
cable
you
can
catch
that
on
tmc
every
once
in
awhile
maybe
on
demand
directed
by
billy
wilder
you
will
see
why
they
had
such
high
regard
for
him
as
a
directot
little
by
little
the
story
takes
shape
as
things
leak
out
things
that
were
not
important
to
know
early
on
in
the
movie
become
plot
twists
and
when
you
think
you
have
it
figured
out
nope
you
might
also
like
movieid
which
so
many
people
insist
is
one
of
the
top
ten
of
all
time
hitchcock
see
that
one
on
the
biggest
tv
you
can
get

on
halloween

amazing
deep
kodakchrome
color
hope
that
ll
get
you
started
but
i
am
sure
you
will
love
movieid
people
did
not
talk
about
anything
else
but
that
movie
in
1950
totally
changed

have
to
be
in
the
mood
movieid

bad

like
all
kinds
of

a
little
different
of
a
disaster
but
a
great
movie
well
i
do
not
want
to

much
however
a
virus

out
when
this
woman
returns
from
a
business
trip

dies

movieid
movieid
was
another
one
i
have
seen
a
top
bodyguard
must
and
a
hitman

then
also
movieid
nicolas
cage
is
convicted
for
a
small
bar
fight
that
because
he
was
militarily
trained
he
was
dangerous
he
spent
time
in
prison
and
the
plot
was
about
him
getting
home
on
a
transport
with
other
really
bad
convicts
have
you
seen
movieid
with
john
travolta
nic
cage
is
in
that
one
too
movieid
is
the
only
one
i
know
hi
i
hope
your
morning
is
going
well
what
sort
of
movie
are
you
interested
in
today
that
is
always
an
interesting
style
I
have
enjoyed
movieid
very
much
also
movieid
is
quite
a
classic
movieid
is
another
one
that
I
have
always
enjoyed
i
think
my
favorite
movie
with
him
is
movieid
it
is
really
full
of
action
i
have
not
seen
that
one
personally
but
it
does
sound
great
that
is
when
all
the
best
ones
were
made
movieid
is
much
newer
and
animated
but
it
does
share
some
great
features
of
them
also
movieid
has
a
lot
of
similarities
oh
movieid
was
great
as
well
bruce
lee
does
still
have
it
if
you
have
not
seen
that
one
yet
you
are
welcome
you
too
hey
there
what
can
i
do
for
you
what
do
you
like
have
you
seen
movieid
or
it
is
sequel
movieid
they
are
good
scary
films
i
bet
you
have
seen
movieid
it
is
one
of
the
best
that
there
is
in
my
opinion
i
consider
the
original
movieid
n
a
great
horror
film
more
than
a
sci
fi
film
never
seen
movieid
so
i
do
not
know
what
to
compare
it
to
sorry
goodbye

about
movieid

was
a
little
over
the
top
but
ok

of
movies

like
older
flicks
you
could
check
out
movieid
or
movieid
some
good
newer
ones
would
be
movieid
and
movieid
movieid
is
about
two
rednecks
who
get
caught
in
some
wild
antics
in
the

other
one
is
about
a
guy
whose
girlfriend
becomes
ill
and
their
struggles
of
the
two
i
would
say
movieid
is
the
better
choice
yep
enjoy
have
a
good
night
okay
what
genre
or
time
period
do
you
prefer
are
you
into
comedy
movieid
is
pretty
good
stars
woody
harrelson
and
jesse
eisenberg
if
you
prefer
more
suspense
try
movieid
with
colin
ferrell
one
of
my
favorites
to
watch
with
my
kids
is
movieid
it
is
old
but
good
also
movieid
is
decent
if
you
are
into
the
found
quot
found
footage
quot
genre
of
sci
fi
it
is
I
am
sure
you
will
love
it
hello
hello
what
kind
of
movies
do
you
like
have
you
seen
movieid
it
is
not
necessarily
a
documentary
but
it
is
based
off
real
events
what
about
movieid
it
is
a
documentary
about
mcdonalds
it
is
pretty
good
and
actually
really
informative
and
entertaining
have
you
seen
movieid
it
is
about
captive
killer
whales
it
really
did
it
is
definitely
not
for
everybody
but
if
you
can
look
through
the
bias
it
is
pretty
interesting
something
a
little
more
entertaining
would
be
movieid
that
one
s
also
really
informative
it
is
about
the
stock
market
and
the
housing
crash
i
think
so
it
also
has
steve
carell
it
is
really
interesting
to
see
him
in
a
more
serious
role
i
think
you
will
like
it
i
hope
those
helped

hello
what
type
of
movie
would
you
like
to
watch
ok
let
me
get
an
understanding
of
ones
you
like
have
you
seen
movieid
lol
okay
ok
how
about
movieid
have
you
seen
that
one
it
is
considered
a
classic
of
the
genera
and
gets
great
reviews
yes
i
was
actually
going
to
suggest
movieid
i
think
it
was
nominated
for
an
oscar
last
year
you
are
welcome
hello
I
would
love
to
recommend
some
movies
for
you
to
watch
if
you
have
some
favorites
you
would
like
to
share
with
me
or
even
your
preferred
genres
alright
let
me
think
and
see
what
i
can
come
up
with
i
saw
movieid
recently
and
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
film
it
has
a
fairly
gruesome
scene
but
could
be
a
good
flick
for
you
it
really
was
very
thought
provoking
i
also
recomend
movieid
if
you
have
not
caught
it
yet
well
it
is
definitely
worth
the
watch
and
i
think
i
know
the
other
movie
that
you
speak
of
but
the
name
is
just
beyond
the
tip
of
my
tongue
another
based
on
a
true
story
film
i
would
recommend
is
movieid
yes
that
is
it
exactly
i
agree
also
one
other
that
popped
into
my
mind
is
movieid
i
would
really
recommend
movieid
it
is
worth
looking
up
you
are
welcome
i
hope
you
enjoy
the
options

a

personally
i
enjoyed
movieid
t
with
robert
de
niro
for
a
good
clean
fantasy
flick
but
for
leo
films
try
movieid
it
is
a
remake
but
they
did
it
well
he
plays
a
millionaire
playboy
in
the
20
s
who
suddenly
appears
on
the
scene
and
throws
wild
parties
but
everybody
thinks
he
is
somebody
different
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
explain
but
it
was
really
good
also
when
he
was
younger
he
was
artie
in
movieid
and
that
showcased
his
talents
very
well
if
you
enjoy
fantasy
sci
fi
at
all
then
movieid
and
the
city
of
a
thousand
planets
would
be
great
for
date
night
oops
typo
but
still
an

i

drama

i
ask
a
few
questions
before
i
list
answers
do
you
want
only
films
that
are
limited
in
violent
images
or
depictions
some
people
are
more
sensitive
to
horror
given
recent
events
there
is
a
very
horrifying
chinese
film
with
subtitles
but
it
does
not
involve
the
supernatural
but
really
chilling
oh
let
me
see
if
its
on
the
allowed
list
one
sec
lol
movieid
very
disturbing
but
no
ghosts
yes
fetuses
to
be
exact
a
variation
on
vampire
cannibals
never
could
have
been
made
in
us
have
you
seen
movieid
it
is
in
spanish
but
there
are
english
subtitles
in
the
version
i
saw
without
giving
you
the
whole
plot
basically
a
young
woman
returns
to
her
home
which
was
an
orphanage
she
wants
to
help
kids
by
opening
a
home
for
kids
but
as
things
would
have
it
in
a
horror
film
something
goes
wrong
very
atmospheric
creepy
good
actually
have
you
seen
an
eli
roth
films
ok
so
you
have
seen
movieid

very
different
from
book
but
really
still
good
film
it
starts
off
fast
and
does
not
stop
very
end
of
world
but
action
well
done

was
siberia
yeah

few
years

kazakhstan

tundra
yak
area

is
all
related
to
corruption

orange
hitler
he
apparently
was
involved
in
a
conman
type
activity
there
too
he
is
a
real
moronic
crook
he
does
not
have
the
balls
he
is
a
coward
and
a
crook
we
have
an
election
november
can
not
wait
well
he
sounds
crazy
so
maybe
he
has
to
be
removed
but
in
november
are
congressional
like
parliment
elections
and
it
is

better
than
the
original
nothing
beats
my
favorite
of
all
time
though
movieid
yes
shows
my
age
haha

a
good
day
then
it
was
good
talking
to
you

hi
there
oh
i
just
recently
saw
the
move
movieid
it
was
pretty
good
i
liked
movieid
that
was
a
good
one
gave
you
seen
the
original
movieid
oops
have
you
seen
i
mean
movieid
was
a
decent
one
i
thought
ok
have
fun
you
are
welcome
dark
christmas
I
will
give
it
a
shot
okay
I
have
got
a
few
first
up
is
movieid
this
one
is
a
collection
of
short
films
with
dark
christmas
themes
krampus
being
one
of
them
there
is
also
movieid
itself
it
is
good
my
kids
liked
it
but
it
is
just
on
the
edge
of
scary
creepy
it
does
not
do
much
to
terrify
you
though
it
is
have
you
seen
it
there
is
also
movieid
it
is
a
cheesy
slasher
flick
with
santa
as
the
killer
my
thoughts
exactly
last
there
is
movieid
about
a
kid
who
goes
on
a
homicidal
rage
dressed
as
santa
pretty
decent

a

my
opinion
the
new
one
has
some
humor
in
it

a
good
flick
though

robin
williams

him
being
in
movieid

are

was
such
a
great

was

in

romantic

the
movieid
you
are
welcome
hello
how
are
you
well
since
it
is
near
christmas
i
will
suggest
some
christmas
movies
movieid
is
pretty
funny
well
my
favorite
nicholas
cage
movie
is
movieid
movieid
is
another
good
one
movieid
it
is
a
romantic
comedy
about
a
cop
cage
who
tips
a
waitress
a
lottery
ticket
and
it
ends
up
being
a
winning
ticket
it
changes
both
of
their
lives
let
us
see
that
all
depends
on
what
it
is
you
are
in
the
mood
for
any
particular
genre
or
time
period
okay
then
first
up
i
have
movieid
with
neve
campbell
the
girl
from
movieid
it
is
about
two
high
school
girls
who
accuse
a
counselor
of
rape
and
seduce
a
cop
pretty
wild
movie
lol
i
would
also
suggest
movieid
it
is
a
sci
fi
movie
set
in
johanesburg
sp
south
africa
an
alien
race
arrives
and
they
are
treated
rather
cruelly
another
sci
fi
film
is
movieid
it
is
less
aliens
and
space
craft
and
more
a
dystopian
drama
about
the
world
after
everyone
has
gone
sterile
clive
owen
is
in
it
and
for
a
bit
of
old
school
horror
I
will
suggest
movieid
it
is
an
old
tales
from
the
crypt
film
it
was
pretty
hilarious
lol
the
crypt
keeper
was
hilarious
hello
movieid
is
a
great
movie
also
the
new
movieid
is
very
funny
yup
that
is
the
one
not
exactly
the
put
a
new
twist
on
it
but
in
a
good
way
in
my
opinion
the
new
movieid
is
better
than
the
original
old
movies
of
movieid
and
movieid
are
also
two
of
my
favorites
those
are
more
action
movies
though
but
still
has
lots
of
comedy
in
them
check
those
out

no
tom
hanks

a
similar
movie
to

part
of
a
subgenre
quot
tom
hanks

somewhere
quot
it
is
about
a
man
who
visits

4th
wall
humor

ok
i
think
we
are
all
done
then
take
care
and
thanks
for
your
time
what
type
of
movies
do
you
usually
like
can
i
assume
that
rated
r
is
okay
and
that
it
is
for
a
date
in
a
theater
did
you
see
movieid
it
won
awards
and
got
great
reviews
movieid

opening
reviews
were
okay
but
not
great
virtual
world
future
save
the
earth
full
of
adventure
movieid
is
still
in
theaters
another
action
flick
but
a
female
is
the
main
character
it
might
appeal
to
both
genders
since
it
is
not
just
guys
beating
each
other
up
hopefully
your
date
will
like
one
of
those
choices
have
fun

i

hi
I

how
are
you
absolutely
I
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
war
or
violent
movies
but
one
of
my
favorite
movies
of
all
time
is
movieid
it
is
very
long
and
very
emotional
but
definitely
worth
taking
a
look
at
it
is
about
the
vietnam
war
starring
robert
di
nero
christopher
walken
and
meryl
streep
yes
i
have
and
i
really
enjoyed
that
movie
as
well
maybe
because
the
two
main
actors
were
very
nice
to
look
at
have
you
seen
movieid
me
too
he
does
a
great
job
in
everything
like
in
movieid
right
we
have
similar
taste
maybe

about
checking

good
show

movieid
i
actually
have
not

that
one
yet
is
it
similar
to
movieid
yeah
i
liked
it
i
just
assumed
they
were
somewhat
similar
would
you
like
another
suggestion
you
too
hi
what
movies
do
you
like
ok
i
liked
movieid
also
liked
movieid
and
movieid
movieid
was
a
lot
of
action
movieid
was
interesting
ok
you
are
welcome
bye
hi
what
type
of
movies
do
you
like
me
too
great
choice
you
need
to
see
movieid
movieid
and
the
classic
movieid
great
movies
if
you
have
not
seen
any
of
them
yet
hello
what
kind
of
movies
do
you
enjoy
okay
have
you
movieid
that
one
got
good
reviews
cool
movieid
was
pretty
good
that
was
a
good
one
did
you
see
movieid
my
daughter
really
liked
that
one
I
will
find
you
some
one
moment
please
movieid
was
a
good
killer
movie
and
also
movieid
with
morgan
freeman
did
you
see
movieid
that
is
similar
bye
sure
what
are
you
looking
for
okay
have
you
seen
movieid
if
you
liked
the
original
you
will
love
the
new
one
also
movieid
mummy
was
good
it
is
more
action
than
horror
thought
movieid
is
good
a
little
more
fantasy
than
horror
but
it
has
werewolves
and
vampires
i
did
not
too
much
care
for
movieid
but
the
rest
of
the
franchise
is
decent
because
its
a
prequel
and
does
not
deal
with
the
primary
timeline
from
the
first
film
the
best
of
the
franchise
in
my
opinion
is
movieid
it
explains
more
of
the
backstory
of
the
blood
fued
between
the
two
races
hi

of
my

the
covers
back
and

movieid
movies
movieid
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
films
if
you
like
superhero
movies
but
do
not
mind
seeing
something
that
is
more
of
a
deconstruction
of
the
genre
i
highly
recommend
movieid
with
rainn
wilson
and
ellen
page
it
is
very
dark
and
gritty
and
kind
of
explores
how
sometimes
trying
to
be
quot
heroic
quot
can
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
ever
saw
movieid
it
is
very
similar
you
are
welcome
have
a
great
day
hello
what
type
of
movie
can
i
help
you
find
have
you
seen
movieid
an
fbi
agent
who
goes
undercover
because
he
is
convinced
a
bunch
of
surfers
robbed
a
bank
sounds
kind
of
dumb
but
i
promise
it
is
actually
really
good
i
loved
movieid
you
should
if
you
liked
that
one
you
will
probably
also
like
movieid
it
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
very
well
executed
sounds
good
have
a
great
weekend
hi
as
far
as
recent
movies
i
enjoyed
movieid
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
it
is
got
a
soundtrack
reminiscent
of
80s
sci
fi
films
and
the
comedy
is
perfectly
spread
out
through
the
film
also
it
is
got
jeff
goldblum
doing
what
he
does
best
i
think
it
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
the
only
prerequisite
viewing
if
any
would
be
the
second
thor
i
think
i
also
recently
saw
movieid
it
is
christina
ricci
in
a
comedy
set
at
a
rennaissance
faire
the
jokes
are
kind
of
raunchy
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
that
is
one
i
wanted
to
see
last
year
but
i
did
not
find
the
time
for
it
did
you
see
movieid
it
is
a
judd
apatow
produced
comedy
about
a
man
who
is
trying
to
reconcile
his
family
s
traditional
values
in
marriage
and
his
interest
in
a
woman
whom
his
family
would
not
consider
who
also
has
a
serious
illness
no
problem
i
hope
you
enjoy
it

care

pretty
good
if

it

do
not
compare
it
to
other
films
there

also
2
sequesl
movieid

similar
to

movieid

were
not
for
the
difference

in
mind
you
would
like
to
get
suggestions
for
the
first
one
that
comes
to
mind
is

not
sure
if
that
is
what
you
mean
movieid
came
to
mind
as
well
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
actually
a
sports
movie
one
second
while
i
think
of
some
others
that
is
what
i
figured
I
am
not
sure
if
i
have
ever
actually
watched
a
movie
focused
on
the
game
itself
is
movieid
along
the
lines
of
what
you
are
thinking
of
I
have
never
watched
movieid
but
some
actual
nba
athletes
play
themselves
in
the
movie
so
it
might
be
something
you
would
like
I
have
heard
of
that
but
have
not
watched
the
only
other
movie

up
with
is

not
give
better
suggestions

am
just
not
familiar

the

a
great

my

for
sure
anything

movieid
would
be
a
good
choice
i
do
not

think
they
advertise
towards

bond
movieid
is
the
movie
of
the
year
for
me

disney

it

has
fairies

future
dystopia
quite
the
film

a
great
one
an

implicated
in
the
murder

clear
himself
i
loved
watching
this
one
movieid

a
good
one
a

school
slacker
commits
a
shocking
act
and
proceeds
to
let
his
friends
in
on
the
secret
however
the
friends
reaction
is
almost
as
ambiguous
and
perplexing
as
the
crime
itself
i
saw
this
in
high
school
and
i
still
love
it
movieid
is

serious
norse

kinda
wish

not
include
harrison
ford

you
looking

do
you
mean
in
the
sense
of
being
a
bit
tasteless
in
the
comedy
department
i
was
thinking
of

along
the
same
lines

it
out
there
anyway

it
is

i
have
heard

wwii
one
that
someone
recommended

can
not
figure

not
seem
right

feel
like
that
was
movieid
too

to

if
you
like
car
related
action
i
would
definitely
suggest
movieid
or
perhaps
you
would
be
interested
in
movieid
i
lean
more
towards
thrillers
and
comedies
personally
hope
my
suggestions
were
helpful
have
a
great
night
hi
what
kind
of
movies
do
you
like
hmm
i
saw
movieid
recently
with
rdj
that
movie
does
not
have
a
supernatural
element
though
it
is
about
a
son
s
strained
relationship
with
his
father
a
small
town
judge
the
son
must
defend
his
father
on
a
murder
allegation
not
really
a
thriller
though
how
about
a
90s
thriller
movieid
who
doesn
t
how
about
movieid
that
is
a
90s
thriller
it
is
about
a
vast
conspiracy
on
the
intenet
with
very
outdated
technology
and
probably
where
we
get
a
lot
of
incorrect
hacker
stereotypes
it
is
fun
it
is
not
good
i
like
it
yes
that
one
is
good
my
friend
used
to
quote
dicaprio
from
it
a
lot
i
forgot
what
he
said
though
i
kind
of
do
not
want
to
see
it
because
it
sounds
really
graphic
but
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
a
lot
how
do
you
feel
about
movieid
it
is
good
but
maybe
unrealistic
it
is
hard
to
believe
anyone
is
a
genius
the
way
matt
damon
s
character
is
but
i
just
love
the
monologue
where
he
interviews
with
the
nsa
yeah
that
became
a
meme
also
it
makes
me
miss
robin
williams

somewhat
similar
to

morning

movie
you

like
so
many
films
are
with
killings
have
you
seen
movieid
comedy
very
funny
and
irreverant
what
about
movieid
that
was
from
2004
i
think
no
very
romantic
kinda
a
tearjerker
good
an
inspirational
film
based
on
fact
is
movieid
about
women
in
nasa
in
the
early
days
i
had
no
idea
about
what
the
film
was
about
in
terms
of
history
but
really
cool
no
i
mean
i
understood
the
movie
but
the
history
really
was
hidden
and
did
you
see
movieid
there
is
no
real
violence
in
that
ok
it
is
premise
is
based
on
someone
trying
to
knock
someone
off
but
it
is
a
comedy
enjoy
hope
you
like
one
or
all
of
them
you
too

you

it
me
too
I
am
not
sure
i
may
have
what
happens
in
it
it

really
familiar
that
one
i
have
not
seen
ahhh
yes
that
is
the
one
i
really
wanted
to
smack
gaylord
in
that
one
he
could
have
avoided
a
lot
of
problems
if
he
just
stopped
lying
how
about
movieid
i
do
not
think
this
one
is
as
funny
but
it
is
kind
of
like
a
fairytale
if
you
are
into
romance
that
was
truly
horrifying
haha
no
problem
do
not
forget
the
pint
of
ice
cream

either
laugh

help
i
do
not
like
scary
films
because
they
rarely
are
scary
just
gross
but
as
for
funny
films
i
would
say
movieid
combines
scary
and
funny
as
does
movieid
i
think
the
movieid
is
the
scariest
ever
and
go
and
watch
some
movieid
films
if
you

how
about

do
you
think
you

its
basically
about
a
family
that

a
hot
mess
and
the
mom
dies
her
final
wish
is

in
the
house
from
there
different
relationships
start
end

of
other
moments
along
the
way
alright

i
hope

the
movie
hello
what
kind
of

scary
i
loved
it

hello
how
are
you
sure
although
i
have
to
admit
i
think
a
lot
of
my
expertise
in
this
genre
is
a
bit
dated
so
i
hope
you
have
not
seen
a
ton
of
my
suggestions
have
you
ever
watched
movieid
it
is
kinda
an
oldie
but
still
good
i
think
matthew
mcconaughey
is
one
of
my
favorite
actors
in
anything
this
one
is
less
comical
and
a
little
more
serious
but
i
was
a
big
fan
of
movieid
the
film
stars
bradley
cooper
and
jennifer
lawrence
and
the
main
plot
surrounds
them
entering
a
dance
competition
in
an
attempt
by
cooper
to
win
back
his
estranged
wife
you
will
have

wondering
why

what
happens
in
the
supernatural
world
especially
when
it
is
a
reality
yeah
but
that
is
what
makes
movieid

fact
of
not
truly
knowing
why
it
happens

hmm
on
them
all

total
crap
okay
then
have
a
great
day
hi
what

you
my
little
cousin

she
watches

over

over
again
i

as
the
original
but
they
really
pulled
it

i
understand
why
some
do
have
you
seen
movieid
very
similar
to
fifty
shades
I
am
trying
to
think
of
other
similar
ones
you
may
also
like
movieid

movieid
more
thriller
than
romance

goodbye
hello
what
kind
of
movies
are
you
interested
in
have
you
seen
movieid
that
one
was
pretty
scary
it
is
pretty
good
and
it
has
a
sequel
movieid
those
could
both
be
good
for
you
what
about
movieid
haha
that
would
be
a
real
concern
the
first
half
is
pretty
creepy
but
it
is
a
great
horror
movie
have
you
seen
movieid
yea
i
was
not
as
big
of
a
fan
either
but
it
is
pretty
good
for
those
who
get
nightmares
as
it
is
not
too
scary
lol
i
hope
those
suggestions
helped
bye

really
like
movieid

romance
movie
imo
movieid
is
one
many
people
enjoy
movieid

another
romantic
film

money

not
really
about
horses

in
the
movie
does
ride
horses
during
the
movie
the
move
movieid
was
also
quite
good
but
it
is
aimed
at
a
more
mature
audience
i
can
not
think
of
any
more
movies
about
horses
what
else
does
your
daughter

lesser
known
prince

day
hello
human
i
mean
fellow
human
speaking
of
which
know
any
good
space
movies
i
know
a
terrible
one
if
you
want
a
good
laugh
movieid
is
so
bad
it
is
funny
i
love
the
alien
series
i
suppose
there
are
the
sequels
but
that
is
hardly
insightful
the
television
series
the
expanse
is
currently
where
i
fill
that
gap
in
my
life
though
that
is
not
a
movie
i
did
not
know
that
how
about
movieid
for
a
one
off
night
joke
movie
i
used
to
pretend
the
headlights
of
cars
were
clown
noses
and
shoot
them
with
my
cousin
in
the
backseat
memories
it
does
seem
like
they
rely
on
getting
quiet
and
then
jump
scaring
rather
than
suspense
and
being
terrifying
not
to
mention
the
ongoing
issue
of
just
repeating
the
same
story
over
and
over
truly
movieid
was
a
thousand
times
better
than
movieid
have
you
seen
the
latest
star
wars
film
movieid
i
have
not
gotten
around
to
it
yet
movieid
movieid
and
movieid
were
the
best
the
80s
produced
outside
of
the
slew
of
ski
movies
i
like
as
a
guilty
pleasure
and
with
that
i
must
leave
hope
to
see
you
around
hello
i
am
doing
well
yourself
is
there
anything
specific
you
are
looking
for
the
last
movie
i
watched
that
i
really
enjoyed
was
movieid
although
i
was
a
little
late
to
the
game
with
that
i
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
it
i
also
watched
movieid
recently
and
enjoyed
it
as
well
exactly
i
did
not
watch
it
because
i
was
not
a
fan
of
other
dc
movies
I
am
much
more
of
a
marvel
fan
movieid
is
still
one
of
my
favorities
that
was
not
one

my
opinion

watch
anyway

not
miss
any
pieces
of
the
story

category
just
a
second
I
am
going
to
assume
you
have
watched
the
movieid
movies
so
I
will
go
to
something
different
have
you
seen
movieid
have
you
seen
movieid
or
movieid
i
see
I
am
the
same
way
actually
i
just
do
not
like
the
dc
universe
do
you
have
any
interest
in
movies
like
movieid
i
thought
it
was
a
great
movie
even
though
I
am
not
normally
interest
in
those
sorts
of
story
lines
this
movie
is
a
little
older
but
i
thought
movieid
the
original
was
good
american
I
have
never
seen
the
swedish
version
maybe
i
should
watch
it
cool
i
hope
you
like
some
of
those
have
a
good
weekend
goodbye
hi
how
are
you
today
i
think
i
know
a
few
you
may
like
movieid
was
pretty
good
movieid
had
great
reviews
and
netflix
just
added
it
it
has
some
horror
aspects
i
have
one
more
movieid
was
good
it
is
older
but
still
good
i
hope
you
enjoy
them
have
a
good
day
hi
can
you
recommend
a
recent
sci
fi
movie
i
recently
saw
movieid
it
was
excellent
but
it
was
very
sad
sure
that
was
also
a
great
movie
i
saw
it
years
ago
alec
baldwin
was
amazing
let
me
think
of
another
good
drama
have
you
seen
movieid
it
is
a
drama
about
winston
churchill
how
about
a
drama
with
some
light
comedy
like
movieid
no
it
is
about
a
highschool
girl
who
calls
herself
ladybird
the
movie
is
about
her
coming
of
age
struggles
i
think
they
would
relate
to
it
very
well
I
am
glad
i
could
help
enjoy
hi
was
not
movieid
considered
a
comedy
of
sorts
it
had
steve
martin
in
it
right

are
looking
for
a
film

than
movieid

have
seen
the
movie
movieid
with
tom
hanks

his
best
film

is
a
mermaid

goes
to
nyc
it
is
cute

utterly
unbelievable

about
one
more

horror
paranormal

welcome
hello
any
movie
genres
you
like
or
do
you
have
a
favorite
movie
oh
that
was
a
romantic
comedy
have
you
seen
movieid
or
did
you
see
movieid
ya
very
good
ones
also
another
classic
is
movieid
oh
nice
you
are
welcome
bye
hey
there
how
can
i
help
you
find
some
movies
today
okay
sure
thing
just
a
moment
how
about
movieid
have
you
seen
that
one
yet
ah
well
they
certainly
encounter
a
black
bear
heh
and
it
has
a
couple
and
did
you
like
it
how
about
movieid
that
is
a
classic
at
this
point
maybe
you
have
not
seen
it
yet
yeah
it
was
not
the
greatest
movie
but
the
genre
is
not
all
too
common
so
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
yeah
i
agree
it
is
a
pretty
entertaining
genre
to
watch
have
you
seen
movieid
though
gotcha
yeah
it
worth
a
try
hah
how
about
movieid
i
really
like
that
one
one
of
my
favorites
highly
recommend
it
i
love
the
scenery
of
the
movie
also
hmm
I
am
not
sure
but
i
do
not
think
so
you
could
probably
rent
it
from
some
other
service
well
however
you
find
it
you
will
not
be
disappointed
for
putting
the
effort
in
finding
it
it
is
a
little
different
but
check
out
movieid
it
is
based
on
a
true
story
apparently
have
you
seen
it
okay
sure
well
i
think
it
is
worth
watching
it
might
not
be
as
good
as
the
other
suggestions
but
if
like
that
sort
of
genre
you
will
probably
enjoy
it
anyhow
i
think
I
am
out
of
ideas
so
i
hope
you
enjoy
some
of
those
have
a
good

morgan
freeman

very
good
comedy
i

kind
of
movies
do

like
i
liked

is
supposed
to
be
really
funny
too
but
i
kinda
liked
movieid
i
just
will
not
admit
it
in
front
of
anyone
thanks
oh
have
you
tried
movieid
it
is
kinda
funny
have
a
great
day
hi
can
i
help
you
find
a
movie
i
love
documentaries
is
something
along
the
line
of
a
michael
moore
film
something
you
might
be
open
to
one
film
michael
moore
did
was
called
movieid
it
is
about
how
even
people
with
medical
insurance
arent
covered
for
medical
care
by
many
insurance
companies
the
other
newer
one
of
his
is
called
movieid
it
is
based
on
the
premise
that
if
you
invade
a
country
and
win
you
as
winner
get
to
take
something
from
them
so
in
france
we
take
away
their
school
lunch
program
where
children
are
fed
good
meals
on
real
plates
and
taught
about
good
food
vs
in
the
us
where
kids
are
fed
variants
of
prison
chow
so
he
goes
around
the
world
showing
how
other
nations
do
things
it
is
pretty
eye
opening
movieid
is
about
fracking
and
how
it
is
potentially
destroying
a
good
deal
of
our
water
supply
especially
the
scene
when
they
can
light
their
water
on
fire
ok
hope
you
like
whatever
you
choose
to
watch
bye
no
problem
movieid
it
is
about
corporate
farming
if
nothing
else
movieid
encourages
us
to
be
aware
about
choices
what
we
put
in
our
mouths
it
was
stunning
look
at
food

comedy

i
loved
wonder

was
also
surprised
at
how
well
they
did
cyborg
who

usually
left
out
of
justice
league
stories
half
the
time
have
you
seen
movieid
i
did
not
expect
to
like
it
as
much
as
i
did
but
it
is
soundtrack
is
reminiscent
of
1980s
film
and
the
humor
keeps
a
light
hearted
approach
to
an
otherwise
dark
film
plus
jeff
goldblum
doing
what
jeff
goldblum

only
he
has
these
two
huge
crystal
like
objects
protruding
from

a
pretty

at
the
end
yeah
he
looks
like
regular
godzilla
only
he
has
these
two
huge
crystal
like
objects
protruding
from
his
back
it
is
a
pretty
cool
fight
sequence
at
the
end
also
there
is
a
newer
version
of
mechagodzilla
in
movieid
it
is
a
japanese
release
but
great
no
this
mechagodzilla
is
built
by
the
government
using
a
dead
godzilla
s
bones
there
is
also
a
sequel
movieid

japanese
release

reborn

only
matched
by
j
law
falling
down
again
this
year
at
the
awards
ceremony
movieid
is
also
highly
rated
although
it
seems
to
be
an
allegory
that
was
probably
more
apropos
during
the
cold
war
still
ala
carte
it
is
packing
a
punch

also
managed
to
have
a
good
plot
wow
i
really
thought
it
was
scary
maybe
it
was
just
because
i
watched

was
relatively
young

bye
good
evening
I
have
got
a
few
in
mind
if
you
like
joss
whedon
and
shakespeare
check
out
movieid
it
is
a
modern
retelling
of
the
play
maintaining
elizabethan
language
starring
a
lot
of
mr
whedon
veterans
mr
whedon
s
sorry
my
spelling
is
off
tonight
i
also
enjoy
kevin
smith
and
the
one
film
that
truly
brought
him
to
prominence
was
movieid
it
diverts
from
the
traditional
ending
but
it
still
has
a
great
message
it
is
not
my
favorite
by
him
but
it
is
one
of
his
best
from
a
technical
and
artist
perspective
now
i
have
the
music
stuck
in
my
head
it
is
all
good
though
I
have
got
a
quirky
romantic
comedy
if
you
are
interested
movieid
the
jokes
can
get
raunchy
but
it
is
a
cool
like
flick
where
christina
ricci
stretches
her
acting
chops
in
a
renaissance
faire
no
problem
now
to
try
and
get
some
catchy
songs
out
of
my
head
have
a
good
night
hello
great
how
are
you
what
kind
of

are
you
into

cool
what
about
movieid

of
something
else
like
movieid

unique

the
same
thing
have
you
ever
seen
movieid

interesting
story

clown
factor
in

movieid
he
was
in
an
ensemble
cast
with

an
isolated
stretch

50
miles

r

in
an
incessant
twenty
four
hour
a
day
seven

a
mute
man
ventures
into
a
near
future
berlin
s
seamy
underworld

remake
it

lots
of
action
also
i
have
not
seen
that

before
I

few
you

movieid
i
like
them
both
but
what
can
i
recommend
for
you
lol
i
understand
well
what
about
movieid
it
is
not
very
horrific
but
it
is
good
and
psychological
i
see
well
in
that
case
you
want
to
check
out
movieid
that
is
very
good
very
similar
to
denzel
s
film
but
it
is
about
the
btk
killer
not
at
all
there
are
a
few
violent
scenes
but
the
movies
is
mainly
a
deep
mystery
you
are
welcome

am
good
have
you
seen

for
i
like
movieid
with
tom
arnold
i
find
it
funny
also
i
can
suggest
movieid
which
is
now
a
musical
its
a
family
who
is
so
dumb
that
they
accidentally
get
involved
in
a
conspiracy
and
help
solve
it
yes
that
is
a
good
joke
with
the
again
i
even
named
my
cat
petunia
after
the
daughter
in
the
movie
it
has
a
dear
place
in
my
heart
but
it
is
really
so
stupid
that
it
is
funny
no
not
at
all
your
welcome
goodbye
hi
what
movies
are
you
looking
for
okay
a
good
dramedy
is
movieid
with
jennifer
lawrence
for
some
good
drama
and
comedy
movieid
with
her
and
christ
pratt
is
another
good
one
bboth
of
those
are
pretty
good
both
funny
with
some
drama
in
it
plus
her
sense
of
humor
really
makes
the
move
have
you
seen
movieid
with
emma
roberts
that
is
another
good
movie
that
one
is
about
kids
in
a
psychiatric
ward
but
it
is
really
funny
it
also
with
the
guy
from
the
hangover
zach
galifinakis
it
so
under
rated
but
such
a
good
movie
it
has
the
drama
of
movieid
with
the
humor
of
movieid
so
it
is
really
good
that
is
such
a
good
movie
what
about
the
movie
movieid
with
woody
hareson
i
honestly
thought
it
was
going
to
be
bad
but
it
turned
out
to
be
such
a
funny
movie
it
is
about
a
girl
who
tells
her
teacher
woody
harelson
that
she
is
going
to
kill
herself
it
is
sounds
intense
but
if
a
light
comedy
you
are
welcome
have
a
good
day
hi

kind

are
quite
recent
also
movieid
while
not
