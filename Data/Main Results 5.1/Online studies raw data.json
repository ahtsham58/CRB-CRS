          "remarks" : "I like this feature, but I would suggest that maybe the chatbot can actually pull data from the IMDB api, like the genre/plot when it gives a result. For example, lets say the user asks for a movie like Twilight (2008). The bot should reply like: \"The movie Beautiful Creatures (2013) is a romance fantasy drama like Twilight (2008)\". And then maybe include a little snippet from the API about the plot. Oh! probably even include the a popular actors name or something. Personally, thats what I would like :) I assume that if someone was going to use this chat-bot, and if it suggests movies theyve never heard of, the user is probably going to want to read more about what the movie is about. Otherwise, I like it! Thanks so much!"
