# Data

This folder contains additional material for the paper titled **“Towards Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation”**

Under the ***'Data'*** directory, we have two main directories at the root level. 
The first named ‘Additional Analyses’ contains the data and results for our ***additional analyses***. 
The second named 'Main Results 5.1' contains the data and compiled results of our study mentioned in Section 5.1.



## Main Results 5.1

The description of the content in this directory is as follows.

  1.	The file named ‘Compiled Results.xlsx’ contains our overall analysis and compiled results regarding the online study.

2.	The file named ‘Invalid Trials.xlsx’ contains all the cases where the participants failed attention. Note that each user has 10 dialog situations in this particular file. 

3.	The file named ‘Discarded Cases.xlsx’ contains those cases which we considered inconsistent as reported in the manuscript. There are 8 cases, thereby, 72 (9x8) dialog situations in this file. The specific rules for discarding such cases (as mentioned in the paper) are also mentioned in the second tab of the same file.

4.	Then we have another file named ‘Valid Trials.xlsx’, which contains data of only valid cases. The valid cases fulfill the following criteria as reported in the manuscript. 

    a.	The attention check is passed
   
    b.	The inconsistent cases found after manual inspection are discarded

        In this file, each user has 9 dialog situations since the situation that belongs to the attention check is deleted for results analysis.

5.	The file named ‘Demographics Details.xlsx’ contains the demographics details of participants. Please note that we reported demographics data for valid cases only.

6.	The file named ‘HSD Test.xlsx’ contains the results for both the ANOVA test and Tukey’s HSD test.

7.	The file named ‘Online studies raw data.json’ contains raw data of our studies in the form of JSON.

8.	Finally, the file named ‘ReadMe for JSON data.docx’ includes a description regarding how to read the JSON data for a particular participant.


## Additional Analyses
 
There are in total three analyses that we reported in the paper. The details of these analyses are as follows.

### 1.  Analysis 5.2.1

   The directory named 'Analysis 5.2.1' contains three files.

   1. The file named 'Total Trials.xlsx' contains the data for all the cases, where the last seeker utterance ends with a particular question.

   2. The file named 'Unique Questions' contains only the unique trials, where the last seeker utterance ends with a particular question.

   3. Finally, the file named 'Complied results' contains the results of our analysis.



### 2.  Analysis 5.2.2
   
   The file named 'Analysis 5.2.2.xlsx' contains the trials, where all the three systems are rated either 'entirely meaningless' or 'meaningless'. The results of this analysis are also contained in the second tab of the same file.

### 3.  Analysis 5.2.3

The file named 'Analysis 5.2.3.xlsx' contains the results of our analysis regarding different ways of preference expression the users used to seek recommendations.
